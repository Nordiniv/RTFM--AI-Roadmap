# The book of Numbers: a **personal** roadmap for me and machines to learn
*I'll try here to make a new and usefull path to take you from **أبجدهوز** to*

**دَعوني أُوَفّي السَيفَ في الحَربِ حَقَّهُ .. وَأَشرَبُ مِن كاسِ المَنِيَّةِ صافِيا**

**وَمَن قالَ إِنّي سَيِّدٌ وَاِبنُ سَيِّدٍ .. فَسَيفي وَهَذا الرُمحُ عَمّي وَخالِيا** <br>

## 1. Genesis: It's here that we begin our journey
### 1.1. The numbers
$77+33 \neq 100$ , already know that? You're good to go.

### 1.2. The tools
You need a PC of course, and you need to know how to use it. We'll be using **Linux** in WSL, **Bash** as our shell, and **VSCode** as our editor. If you're not familiar with any of these, you can learn them from:
- [WSL](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilKQHAFeQR0)
- [The Missing Semester of Your CS Education](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/)
- [VSCode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S320N3sxinE)

*Just search, ask, and try to follow along.*


### 1.3. Pick an axe
You can't do anything without an axe, so pick one. We'll be using the **Python** axe, if you have another one, it's not totally wasted knowledge, but you'll have to translate it to Python.

We'll walk through the first two courses on Python basics from [DataCamp](https://app.datacamp.com/learn/career-tracks/data-scientist-with-python) along with the first two chapters of [Numerical Python Book](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4842-4246-9)

### 1.4. Grok the basics
You can't do anything without knowing the basics, so grok them. We'll be going along the book [Grokking Algorithms](https://www.manning.com/books/grokking-algorithms) by **Aditya Y. Bhargava**. It's a good book, and it's free, so you have no excuse. It's also a good idea to [know writing efficient Python code](https://app.datacamp.com/learn/courses/writing-efficient-python-code)

### 1.5. Writing aesthetics
Learning and documenting are two faces of a fair coin, toss it high and you have a $50\%$ chance of either. So, learn to write, and write to learn. We'll be using the $\LaTeX$ and **Markdown** to write documents just like this one you're reading right now. A good guide would be [LaTeX in 24 Hours](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-319-47831-9) by **Dilip Datta**. You can also use [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Learn_LaTeX_in_30_minutes) to write your documents online.

Then we might take the $3^{rd}$ and $4^{th}$ chapters from Numerical Python Book.

### 1.6. The math
A musician has a nightmare where music education has become mandatory and is controlled by educators, school systems, and the state. Students are taught to read and write music notation, while playing, listening, and composing are considered advanced topics. The pressure to excel in music intensifies in higher grades, and students must take courses in various musical theories. However, most students are bored, disinterested, and have poor skills in music. The musician wakes up and realizes that such a scenario is absurd, but weirdly enough, it is similar to what happens in mathematics education. [— Lockhart's Lament](https://www.maa.org/external_archive/devlin/LockhartsLament.pdf)

We'll be using the book [Mathematics for Machine Learning](https://mml-book.github.io/) by **Marc Peter Deisenroth, A Aldo Faisal, and Cheng Soon Ong** along with the [Imperial College London's course](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/mathematics-machine-learning) on Coursera. It's a good idea to go through [Math better explained](https://betterexplained.com/ebook/math/) and [Calculus Better Explained](https://betterexplained.com/calculus/) by **Kalid Azad** first. Then we'll practise that from the chapters 5 through 11.


## 2. Ecclesiastes: There's nothing new under the sun

### 2.1. The data
 Only then we can take the course [Data Manipulation with pandas](https://app.datacamp.com/learn/courses/data-manipulation-with-pandas) and [Joining Data with pandas](https://app.datacamp.com/learn/courses/joining-data-with-pandas) along with the $12^{th}$ Chapter of Numerical Python.
 
### 2.2. You think you know it all?
We will go through Stanford's [STAT110](https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/stat110/home) course on probability and statistics. along with the book [Introduction to Probability](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VmkAAGOYCTORq1wxSQqy255qLJjTNvBI/view) by **Joseph K. Blitzstein and Jessica Hwang** and Practise from the $13^{th}$ Chapter of Numerical Python and [Introduction to Statistics in Python](https://app.datacamp.com/learn/courses/introduction-to-statistics-in-python). After that we'll pause our work in Numerical Python with the $14^{th}$ Chapter.

### 2.3. Show time!
It's then the time to show off; creating visualizations and exploring data is cruical in our job. We'll go with the Viz and EDA courses from DataCamp.

## 3. Revelation: I created a monster!

### 3.0. The monster
Before going into the den, we probably need to learn first about it. I'll start by [Grokking Artificial Intelligence Algorithms](https://www.manning.com/books/grokking-artificial-intelligence-algorithms)

### 3.1. Machine Learning
It's now the time to create your machine monsters! We'll skim through the $2^{nd}$ part of the MML book, just to know more about these kinds of things, then we will start ML with the famous [Machine Learning Course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) by **Andrew** on Coursera, along with [The Hundred-Page Machine Learning Book](http://themlbook.com/wiki/doku.php) by **Andriy Burkov** and the practice notebooks from [Hands-On Machine Learning](https://github.com/ageron/handson-ml2) by **Aurélien Géron** for the machine learning parts, and [fastai's notebooks](https://github.com/fastai/fastbook) by **Jeremy Howard and Sylvain Gugger** for the deep learning parts.

Then we would finish the [Data Scientist with Python](https://app.datacamp.com/learn/career-tracks/data-scientist-with-python) career track on DataCamp and the last 5 chapters form Numerical Python.

### 3.2. Deep Learning
Up-to-now, we had a good introduction for deep learning, but we need to go *deeper*. We'll take the [Deep Learning with PyTorch](https://www.manning.com/books/deep-learning-with-pytorch) by **Eli Stevens, Luca Antiga, and Thomas Viehmann**

Now we have a very good foundation, we may proceed to learning fastai from the [fastai course](https://course.fast.ai/) along with the rest of the fast book.

### 3.3. To infinity and beyond
I think we're now ready to explore advanced topics in deep learning, we'll hit the [Deep Learning Book](https://www.deeplearningbook.org/) by **Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio, and Aaron Courville** for theory and [Dive into Deep Learning](https://d2l.ai/) by **Aston Zhang, Zachary C. Lipton, Mu Li, and Alexander J. Smola** for practice and contrast the PyTorch implementation with the JAX implementation.
Then we'll go on to learn JAX in depth from the [JAX 101](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/jax-101/index.html) and [JAX 201](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/jax-201/index.html) courses. and it's now your time to go on your own.

I'm still working on this, so it's surely not perfect as I'm still learning myself, but I hope it helps you. If you have any suggestions, please let me know.
